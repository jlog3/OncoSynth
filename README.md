# OncoSynth: Integrative Cancer Data Analysis Platform
### Overview
OncoSynth is a groundbreaking platform designed to revolutionize the way researchers and clinicians approach cancer data. At its core, OncoSynth fuses rich datasets from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), encompassing RNASeq, clinical data, and cancer staging, with detailed patient data from Synthea, including personal details, conditions, procedures, and medications.

### Key Features
Differential Expression Analysis (DEA): Utilizes state-of-the-art DEA methods to overlay data onto biological pathways, enhancing understanding of cancer mechanisms.
Pathway Visualization: Integrates normal tissue RNASeq data with cancer datasets for comprehensive pathway analysis.
Multi-Dimensional Data Integration: Seamlessly combines genomic, clinical, and patient-specific data for a holistic view of cancer.
Biomarker Discovery: Facilitates the identification and analysis of potential biomarkers in diverse cancer types.
User-Friendly Interrogation: Allows users to easily query and analyze data based on specific patients or cancer types.
### Goals
OncoSynth aims to:

Empower researchers with a versatile tool for comprehensive cancer data analysis.
Bridge the gap between genomic data and clinical applicability.
Enhance the understanding of cancer biology, aiding in the development of personalized medicine approaches.
